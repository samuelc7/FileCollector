# FileCollector
Takes in a root path of cpp project and finds and collects all of the locations of each cpp and header file within all  the subdirectories..

This is just a proof of concept for the time being. Eventually, the FileCollector will contribute to finding all of the packages a c++ project uses for SBOM purposes.
